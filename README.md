Objective

The lab aims to familiarize with PyTorch for Classification and Regression tasks using Deep Neural Network architectures.
Part One: Regression

    EDA: Understand and visualize the dataset.
    DNN Architecture: Design a PyTorch DNN for regression.
    GridSearch: Tune hyperparameters for efficiency.
    Visualization: Plot loss and accuracy trends.
    Regularization: Compare results with and without regularization.

Part Two: Multi-Class Classification

    Pre-processing: Clean and standardize/normalize the dataset.
    EDA: Explore and visualize the dataset.
    Data Augmentation: Balance the dataset.
    DNN Architecture: Create a PyTorch model for classification.
    GridSearch: Optimize hyperparameters.
    Visualization: Plot loss and accuracy trends.
    Metrics: Calculate accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, etc.
    Regularization: Compare results with and without regularization
